Analyze a Specific Site
=======================

Weakly druggable sites can be missed in druggability analysis step. Or,
a site of interest might be partly identified. Druggability of a specific
site can be calculated using the following interface:

   :scale: 80%


Input Files
-----------

Input files area list of ligand :file:`.pdb` files and :file:`.dso` file
from previous step. Ligand-bound form of the protein should be aligned
to the simulated structure. You can use :file:`prefix_heavyatoms.pdb`
file for alignment.


Options & Parameters
--------------------

1. Parameters determined how many probe binding spots are incorporated in
   assessment of the specified site. Selected probe should be close to
   the ligand, so 1.5 Ã… should be sufficient. If the ligand is bound to
   a weak site, maximum free energy may be lower that that is used in
   the previous step, such as -0.5 kcal/mol.

2. GUI will try to locate Python executable path, but if you do not see an
   entry, you will need to specify it manually.

Output Files
------------

Output from this step is a set of PDB files written into :file:`prefix`
and the druggability of sites specified by ligands.
